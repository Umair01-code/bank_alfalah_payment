```

### Usage Flow

1. Developer configures the package with merchant credentials
2. Developer initiates payment with amount and optional parameters
3. Package shows WebView screen and handles navigation
4. Package processes callback URLs and notifies developer of result
5. Developer handles success or failure based on result callback

### Security Considerations

- Merchant credentials should be stored securely
- All requests must use proper hash generation
- HTTPS must be used for all API calls
- WebView should have restricted navigation abilities
